### Python OAuth

You can use this small webapp to see how Authentication works in Flask Python. 

To run this app first :

Create a virtual environment 
```sh
$ python -m venv .venv
```
and the install the requirements by running 

```sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

Replace the `$.env.local` to `$.env` and replace the values with the correct.

Create a Table `accounts` in DB to put the information of the users somewhere
And Finally run 

```sh
$ flask run
```


Have fun and play around with it .
